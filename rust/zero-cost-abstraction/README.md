# Zero Cost Abstraction

What does this mean?
- You can add abstractions without affecting runtime performance
- improve code quality and readability without any runtime performance cost
- No longer have to trade off between maintainability and performance

# example

```rust
fn add(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 2 - 3 * 5 - x
}
```

this function does not use x, but just return -13 whatever x is.
So, compiler would optimize this.

# Tips

how to write output to assenbly code|[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39219961/how-to-get-assembly-output-from-building-with-cargo)

```bash
cargo rustc -- --emit asm

# for release mode: I recommend this
cargo rustc --release -- --emit asm

# --emit mir (rust intermediate representation)
# --emit llvm-ir (llvm intermediate representation)
# --emit llvm-bc (llvm byte code)
# --emit asm (assembly)
```


Another way, with [cargo-binutils](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils) installed.

use cargo objdump
```bash
# installation
$ cargo install cargo-binutils
$ rustup component add llvm-tools-preview

# disassemble a binary
$ cargo objdump --release -- --disassemble --no-show-raw-insn
```

## Reading disassembly code
general purpose registers
rax: accumulator
rbx: base
rcx: counter
rdx: data

pointers/indexes
rsi: register stack index
rdi: register destination index
rbp: base pointer
rsp: source pointer

control pointer
rip: instruction pointer

>The first four registers rax, rbx, rcx, and rdx, are general purpose registers accumulator, base, counter and data respectively. These registers can be used for a whole host of things, however, in this case, they are used as temporary variables for the CPU, when executing machine code.

>The next four registers rsi, rdi, rbp and rsp are also general purpose, better known as pointers and indexes, the registers above stand for stack index, destination index, base pointer and source pointer, which are used for storing addresses that points to location in memory.

>The rip register is the instruction pointer and will keep track of what the CPU is reading. It is an important register to concentrate on while debugging, as it is essentially the control pointer. The example above shows the CPU is currently pointing at memory address 0x4004f8.

>The final set of eflags registers contain several big flags and are used for comparison and memory segmentation.

## Assembly x86

```rust
fn main() {
    // example2();
    example();
}

fn example() {
    // println!("{}", example::do_stuff(3.0));
    println!("{}", 6.0);
}
```

results in
```asm
_main:
	.cfi_startproc  :beginning of a function
	pushq	%rbp    :push source(rbp) to stack
	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
	.cfi_offset %rbp, -16
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_register %rbp
	subq	$16, %rsp
	movq	%rsi, %rcx
	movslq	%edi, %rdx
	leaq	__ZN21zero_cost_abstraction4main17h2402699a3191719cE(%rip), %rax
	movq	%rax, -8(%rbp)
	leaq	l___unnamed_1(%rip), %rsi

	addq	$16, %rsp
