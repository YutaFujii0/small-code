# expample "abacedeffedecabxyz" -> "bacedeffedecab"

# property of the problem: need to seek valid palindrome for each head string
# idea: dynamic programming?
# - if we know the answer of palindrome of which head is ith, 
# can we induce i+1th palindrome easily? if possible, O(n) solution
# idea: sliding window?

# idea: brute force
# for i in n, check palindrome whose head is ith string
# O(n) * n solution
# feels like this has so many duplicate process...dp may fit?

# in the first place, 
# P: find longest palindrome starting head char? how?

# three pointer? head, middle, tail
#
