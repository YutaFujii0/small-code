# https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/
# strs has at least one string(if that is the case, that string is the answer)
# there's no assurrance strs are in alphabetical order
# given the sorted strs,  can I do this easily? no it doesn't matter
# because what we need to do is answer prefix all elements in strs have in common


# solution
# sort elements: time complexity O(NlogN), space complexitiy: O(NlogN) since we use recurrsive calls
# compare first and last ones and take prefix both have in common
